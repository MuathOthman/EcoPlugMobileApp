## Vision
The vision of the project

Our goal is to simplify the lives of electric vehicle owners by providing real-time monitoring of charging point availability. Charging electric vehicles can be challenging today, as the status of charging points is often unclear, leading to long wait times or issues with reserved points.

## Solution
Creating an intelligent system that allows users to track the status of charging points in real-time. Available charging points are immediately visible to users, and they receive alerts when a point becomes reserved or becomes available.

## Benefits
Our aim is to create an easy-to-use and efficient system that enhances the smoothness of charging electric vehicles. Users can quickly find an available charging point and focus on the hassle-free use of their electric vehicles.

## Next Steps
To realize our vision, we are focusing on developing an efficient charging point monitoring system, designing a user-friendly interface, and ensuring the broader availability of the system to maximize its benefits for electric vehicle users. We also aim to empower users by providing them with the chance to create their own profiles within the system. This will enhance the personalization of the user experience, allowing individuals to customize settings and preferences.
